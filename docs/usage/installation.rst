Installation
============

RolePy runs as `Python 3 <https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/>`_ script. The only not built-in module it uses is `Pygame <https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted>`_. Install it with

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pygame

Finally you just have to clone the repository, with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/ychalier/rolepy.git
