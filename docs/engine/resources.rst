Resources module
================

This small modules provides interfaces between binary resources such as sprites
and the game.

Each **tile** is logically represented either by the
``rolepy.engine.entities.enums.EntityTexture`` or
``rolepy.engine.terrain.TerrainTexture`` enumerations.

Other resources are **fonts**, for which we simply make references to system
fonts.
